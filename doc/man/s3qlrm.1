.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
S3QL is a file system for online data storage. Before using S3QL, make
sure to consult the full documentation (rather than just the man pages
which only briefly document the available userspace commands).
.sp
The \fBs3qlrm\fP command recursively deletes files and directories on an
S3QL file system. Although \fBs3qlrm\fP is faster than using e.g.
\fBrm \-r\(ga\fP, the main reason for its existence is that it allows
you to delete immutable trees (which can be created with
\fBs3qllock\fP) as well.
.sp
Be warned that there is no additional confirmation. The directory will
be removed entirely and immediately.
.sp
\fBs3qlrm\fP can only be called by the user that mounted the file system
and (if the file system was mounted with \fB\-\-allow\-other\fP or
\fB\-\-allow\-root\fP) the root user.
