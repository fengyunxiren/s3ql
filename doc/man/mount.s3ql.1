.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
S3QL is a file system for online data storage. Before using S3QL, make
sure to consult the full documentation (rather than just the man pages
which only briefly document the available userspace commands).
.sp
The \fBmount.s3ql\fP command mounts the S3QL file system stored in \fIstorage
url\fP in the directory \fImount point\fP\&. The storage url depends on the
backend that is used. The S3QL User\(aqs Guide should be consulted for a
description of the available backends.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The \fBmount.s3ql\fP command accepts the following options.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-log \ <target>
Destination for log messages. Specify \fBnone\fP for
standard output or \fBsyslog\fP for the system logging
daemon. Anything else will be interpreted as a file
name. Log files will be rotated when they reach 1 MiB,
and at most 5 old log files will be kept. Default:
\fB~/.s3ql/mount.log\fP
.TP
.BI \-\-cachedir \ <path>
Store cached data in this directory (default:
\fB~/.s3ql)\fP
.TP
.BI \-\-authfile \ <path>
Read authentication credentials from this file
(default: \fB~/.s3ql/authinfo2)\fP
.TP
.BI \-\-debug\-modules \ <modules>
Activate debugging output from specified modules (use
commas to separate multiple modules). Debug messages
will be written to the target specified by the
\fB\-\-log\fP option.
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Activate debugging output from all S3QL modules. Debug
messages will be written to the target specified by
the \fB\-\-log\fP option.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
be really quiet
.TP
.BI \-\-backend\-options \ <options>
Backend specific options (separate by commas). See
backend documentation for available options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
just print program version and exit
.TP
.BI \-\-cachesize \ <size>
Cache size in KiB (default: autodetect).
.TP
.BI \-\-max\-cache\-entries \ <num>
Maximum number of entries in cache (default:
autodetect). Each cache entry requires one file
descriptor, so if you increase this number you have to
make sure that your process file descriptor limit (as
set with \fBulimit \-n\fP) is high enough (at least the
number of cache entries + 100).
.TP
.B \-\-allow\-other
Normally, only the user who called \fBmount.s3ql\fP can
access the mount point. This user then also has full
access to it, independent of individual file
permissions. If the \fB\-\-allow\-other\fP option is
specified, other users can access the mount point as
well and individual file permissions are taken into
account for all users.
.TP
.B \-\-allow\-root
Like \fB\-\-allow\-other\fP, but restrict access to the
mounting user and the root user.
.TP
.B \-\-fg
Do not daemonize, stay in foreground
.TP
.B \-\-upstart
Stay in foreground and raise SIGSTOP once mountpoint
is up.
.TP
.BI \-\-compress \ <algorithm\-lvl>
Compression algorithm and compression level to use
when storing new data. \fIalgorithm\fP may be any of
\fBlzma\fP, \fBbzip2\fP, \fBzlib\fP, or none. \fIlvl\fP may be any
integer from 0 (fastest) to 9 (slowest). Default:
\fBlzma\-6\fP
.TP
.BI \-\-metadata\-upload\-interval \ <seconds>
Interval in seconds between complete metadata uploads.
Set to 0 to disable. Default: 24h.
.TP
.BI \-\-threads \ <no>
Number of parallel upload threads to use (default:
auto).
.TP
.B \-\-nfs
Enable some optimizations for exporting the file
system over NFS. (default: False)
